## Introduction

My company gave a backpack with an LED panel inside it for Christmas. 
I didnt like the software that came with it so I made my own pcb to mount and ESP32 and two wii nunchucks and an accelerometer/gyro at the location of the driver pcb that came with the panel.

## Features

- Fits on the panel in the original location
- Has support for a NodeMCU ESP32 Board
- Has support for a MPU-6050 accelerometer/gyro board
- 5V/GND input pins
- 3V3/GND output pins
